title:Moving onto a keyboard
published:true
---

There is a few things i wanted when i moved to the ipad and one of them was a physical keyboard to be able to type well on.
Now I have that, and whilst it will take a bit of getting used to, it will mean that i can 
Write things allot faster and easier when involving text.

Moving onto a project, i will be working on an app for my watch that will hopefully replace my current copy and paste function (or lack of) within the app i have already bought. 
Whilst it was not the reason i bought the app, it is certainly a limitation i would like to overcome. 

I will post updates on it on here.
