title: Finally fixed jekyll!

It is so nice to finally have a working theme in jekyll. The whole site
just seemed really bare and honestly, boring to update until i managed
to get it working. 

The reason it worked in the end was a suggestion i found on a github issue. It suggested that i remove
a file in the layout folder called default.html

I am so glad it worked, although now i will likely remove that theme and change it to a new one. 

Happy blogger!
