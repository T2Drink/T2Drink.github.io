I started this blog with the aim of discussing my effort to become productive using a combination of my favourite devices.
What will make this a little more interesting than your average fanboy blog? Well, put simply, I use a myriad of different devices. Whilst individually, the items may seem very ordinary, combined.. it caused a me to find a whole host of workarounds and wasted money on things that wouldn't work out. 

I will write about it here.

I use 
A windows 10 pc
A Samsung galaxy s7 edge
A Samsung galaxy watch
An apple iPad Pro 9.7 inch with Apple Pencil.

Read my future updates where I discuss digital note taking.
